#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Problem Based
###### Assessment Method: Generated Figures

<u> <b>Description: </b> of how you are going to implement the above Instructional Strategy in your Simulator: </u>
<br>
 Students can enter the values of the amplitude values of the harmonics and change the entered values accordingly to obtain the periodic square wave. Students can match the obtained values of the harmonics with the theoretical values and obtained the errors.
Scope: Various runs of the same experiment are possible at changing values of flow rates, so that user may completely learn the objectives.

#### 5. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student will click on run button.  | Create a periodic square wave signal.  | Design of a square wave
2.| Students will enter the amplitude values for the integer harmonics to understand the concept of Fourier Series| Show the effect of harmonic values | Describe the purpose in detail.
3.| Student will record the output obtained for the entered values| Provide the relation between a generated periodic signal and conceptual Fourier Series. Simulators provide a graph of the periodic square wave. | To show the effect of different integer harmonic’s amplitude values on generated signal with the help of simulator .Student can relate the effect of harmonics on periodicity.
